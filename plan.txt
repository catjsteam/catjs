Day 1 (23.6)
	Grunt including:
		1) learning ...
		2) creating a basic environment
		3) building a basic project

Day 2
	Grunt including:
		1) Creating CAT project
		2) Parent project which runs two subprojects (plugin, core)
		3) I have an issue working with nodejs fs (file system) :-/

Day 3
		Grunt Issue.. still trying to figure out why I cannot work with fs.extra or pure node fs.
		I found out that running grunt spawn - meaning running nodejs as a child process - works... so something about grunt process is wrong.
		Trying to code standalone node module, running the module from grunt - still not working

Day 4
		Grunt Issue - I found the solution,
		All I had to do it tell grunt that I'm working in async mode. I think that this one sucks big time!!

		// Tell grunt this task is asynchronous.
		var done = this.async();

		At last moving forward to the real stuff... scanning a given project.
		Adding filters support - currently testing excluding files out of a given scanning.

Day 5

	    - Log support - for external file as well.
	    - (Maintenance) support for standalone node modules.
	    - Event management for the actions (e.g. copy); current support file|folder events.
	    - External configuration support - can be used anywhere
	    - Creating test configuration for the san action
	    - Preparing the project for production mode
	    - Preparing a blank CAT project
